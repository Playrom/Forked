Overview ForkedCloudKit makes it easy to sync your Forked data between devices using Apple’s CloudKit framework. This guide will walk you through the basic setup and usage. Getting Started First, make sure you have the ForkedCloudKit subpackage added to your project dependencies. Then import ForkedCloudKit in your source files:  Basic Setup The main class you’ll work with is CloudKitExchange. Here’s how to set it up:  The id parameter should be a unique string that identifies this resource in CloudKit. How It Works CloudKitExchange automatically: Monitors changes to your ForkedResource’s main fork Uploads changes to iCloud when detected Downloads changes from other devices Merges remote changes into your local data on the main fork All of this happens in the background without blocking your app’s UI. Example Implementation Here’s a complete example showing how to integrate CloudKit sync into a SwiftUI app:  CloudKit Setup in Xcode Before your app can use CloudKit: Enable iCloud in your Xcode target’s capabilities tab Choose or add a container (eg “iCloud.com.mycompany.myapp”). The container ID should match the id parameter in your CloudKitExchange initializer. Also enable the background modes for remote notifications and background processing Advanced Usage Custom Container By default, CloudKitExchange uses the default CloudKit container. You can specify a custom container:  Monitoring Sync Updates CloudKitExchange automatically handles sync in the background, but you can monitor when changes from CloudKit are merged into your main fork. To do this, add a Task on launch that monitors the changeStream for changes from CloudKit:  Troubleshooting Common issues and solutions: No Sync: Ensure iCloud is enabled on the device, the user is signed in, and iCloud Drive enabled Data Not Appearing: Check that your CloudKit container is properly configured Conflicts: ForkedCloudKit automatically handles conflicts using your resource’s merge strategy Further Reading CloudKit Documentation Forked Documentation Sample App: Forking Simple iCloud","headings":["Overview","Getting Started","Basic Setup","How It Works","Example Implementation","CloudKit Setup in Xcode","Advanced Usage","Custom Container","Monitoring Sync Updates","Troubleshooting","Further Reading"],"location":{"type":"topLevelPage","reference":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked\/CloudKitIntegration"}},"summary":"Learn how to use ForkedCloudKit to sync your data across devices.","kind":"article"},{"rawIndexableTextContent":"A  type representing a named fork.

Overview Forked provides a safe way to handle shared data by allowing you to create independent branches (forks) of your data that can be modified concurrently and merged later. This guide will walk you through the basic concepts using practical examples. Creating Your First Resource The easiest way to get started is with QuickFork, which manages a single value in memory:  value(in:) returns an optional because the value might not exist in a given fork. When you’re sure the value exists (like right after creation), you can force unwrap with !. In production code, you might want to handle the optional more safely. Working with Forks Creating Named Forks While every resource has a .main fork, you’ll often want to create additional named forks. One convenient approach is to define your forks as static properties in an extension to Fork:  You can also create forks directly if you prefer:  Updating Values You can update values independently in different forks:  Merging Changes When you’re ready to reconcile changes between forks, you can merge them. All merges must go through the main fork - you cannot merge directly between custom forks:  Merging Direction Merging is directional - changes flow from the source fork to the destination fork. To fully synchronize two forks, you need to merge in both directions:  For convenience, there’s a syncMain(with:) method that performs bidirectional merges between main and multiple forks:  Remember that syncing between custom forks still requires going through main. The sync method makes this easier by handling all the necessary merges in each direction. Working with Complex Types While the examples above use simple Int values, Forked really shines when working with complex types.

Centralized vs Decentralized The Traditional Approach Applications traditionally use a centralized approach to manage shared data. At the heart of this approach lies a central coordinator, such as a lock, queue, or actor, which protects the shared resource, providing serial access to it. While this pattern is familiar, it comes with significant drawbacks. Changes must be synchronized through the coordinator, forcing other parts of the system to wait while changes occur. This not only creates bottlenecks and synchronization costs but also makes it challenging to reason about the system’s state, often leading to subtle race conditions. The Decentralized Way Forked takes inspiration from proven distributed version control systems like Git. With these systems, changes flow more naturally. Developers can work independently, without waiting to coordinate with other developers. When conflicts arise, the system has a complete picture of what’s changed through its history tracking. This philosophy translates directly to how Forked operates in your application. You’re free to modify data without considering other subsystems or devices, and reconciliation happens later through well-defined merge policies. The key innovation is Forked’s support for 3-way merging, where a historical “common ancestor” helps determine exactly what’s changed in each fork when a conflict arises. The Reality of Modern Apps Most modern applications are inherently decentralized, whether intentional or not. Consider how your app might sync data across multiple devices, or how app extensions operate in separate processes on shared data. Even background processes performing imports or downloads from a web service must coordinate with the main app. These scenarios all represent decentralized operations, even if we often try to force them into a centralized model. Sync Comes for Free Forked’s decentralized approach means that sync is a natural part of the system. By providing some limited history tracking, in the form of a common ancestor, as well a powerful merging, you can begin developing an app for a single device, and very simply add support for sync with no model changes, and no custom server. Just connect iCloud, and you’re done. Forked and Actor-Based Systems While actors excel at preventing data races through controlled access to shared resources, they can’t prevent higher-level race conditions or solve the complexities of reentrant code and interleaved operations. This is where Forked steps up, complementing actor-based architectures by providing robust conflict management capabilities. Architectural Components The Forked Hub Rather than implementing a full version control system, Forked maintains just enough history for effective 3-way merging, keeping memory usage low. In optimal cases, the size of a ForkedResource is practically the same as the size of the resource it contains. In a ForkedResource, forks are arranged in a hub-and-spoke pattern. The hub is the main fork, while other forks (the spokes) can merge with the main fork, but not directly with each other.  The main fork in the hub stores exactly one copy of the resource — its current value. Other forks, on the other hand, are responsible for keeping track of the common ancestor when updates occur. In this way, a 3-way merge between the main fork and any other fork can be performed at any time. The non-main forks can contain various copies of the resource, based on their relationship to the main fork: When a fork is in sync with the main fork, it stores no additional copies of the resource When the main fork has progressed ahead, the fork retains only the common ancestor copy When the fork conflicts with the main fork, it maintains two copies: the common ancestor and its own most recent value Whenever an update to any fork is made, copies of the resource into forks can arise. For example, take the simple case that all forks are in sync. If an update occurs to the main fork, a copy of the resource is made into all of the non-main forks, because they all need a common ancestor to perform a 3-way merge in future. Later, if the main fork gets fully synced with one of the other forks, that fork will no longer have any copy of the resource. This careful management of state means that: The minimum necessary history is preserved in order to facilitate 3-way merges When all forks are in sync, only one copy of the resource exists in memory Memory usage scales with the number of conflicts, not with the number of forks The spoked architecture keeps the number of common ancestors low, because they aren’t needed for every single pair of forks"},{"title":"<(_:_:)","rawIndexableTextContent":" ","kind":"symbol","location":{"reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked\/Version\/_(_:_:)-1u41m","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"type":"topLevelPage"},"summary":"","headings":[]},{"location":{"reference":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked\/ForkedResource\/syncMain(with:)-18a6t"},"type":"topLevelPage"},"title":"syncMain(with:)","rawIndexableTextContent":"Brings main and the other fork to the same version by first merging from the other fork into main, and then merging from main into the other fork (fast forward).
