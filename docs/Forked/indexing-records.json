Overview Forked provides a comprehensive solution for managing concurrent data access and synchronization through a Git-inspired branching and merging system. Instead of using traditional concurrency primitives like locks or actors, Forked allows you to safely work with multiple copies of data and merge them systematically. Key Concepts Forks A fork represents a branch of your data that can be modified independently of other branches. Every ForkedResource has a main fork, and you can create additional named forks for different purposes like UI updates, background processing, or network synchronization. Resources A ForkedResource manages the state and history of your data across multiple forks. It tracks changes, maintains the common ancestor states needed for merging, and provides methods for updating and querying values in different forks. Merging When forks diverge and need to be reconciled, Forked provides sophisticated merging capabilities. The framework supports both automatic merging for simple types and custom merge strategies for complex data structures.","kind":"symbol","summary":"A framework for handling shared data with confidence in Swift.","location":{"reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"type":"topLevelPage"}},{"location":{"reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked\/CloudKitIntegration","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"type":"topLevelPage"},"kind":"article","rawIndexableTextContent":"Learn how to use ForkedCloudKit for data synchronization.

Overview Forked provides a safe way to handle shared data by allowing you to create independent branches (forks) of your data that can be modified concurrently and merged later. This guide will walk you through the basic concepts using practical examples. Creating Your First Resource The easiest way to get started is with QuickFork, which manages a single value in memory:  value(in:) returns an optional because the value might not exist in a given fork. When you’re sure the value exists (like right after creation), you can force unwrap with !. In production code, you might want to handle the optional more safely. Working with Forks Creating Named Forks While every resource has a .main fork, you’ll often want to create additional named forks. One convenient approach is to define your forks as static properties in an extension to Fork:  You can also create forks directly if you prefer:  Updating Values You can update values independently in different forks:  Merging Changes When you’re ready to reconcile changes between forks, you can merge them. All merges must go through the main fork - you cannot merge directly between custom forks:  Merging Direction Merging is directional - changes flow from the source fork to the destination fork. To fully synchronize two forks, you need to merge in both directions:  For convenience, there’s a syncMain(with:) method that performs bidirectional merges between main and multiple forks:  Remember that syncing between custom forks still requires going through main. The sync method makes this easier by handling all the necessary merges in each direction. Working with Complex Types While the examples above use simple Int values, Forked really shines when working with complex types. Here’s an example using a custom type:  Next Steps Learn about different merging strategies in Merging Strategies Explore automatic model generation with ForkedModel Add CloudKit sync with ForkedCloudKit","headings":["Overview","Creating Your First Resource","Working with Forks","Creating Named Forks","Updating Values","Merging Changes","Merging Direction","Working with Complex Types","Next Steps"],"kind":"article","location":{"reference":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked\/GettingStarted"},"type":"topLevelPage"},"summary":"Learn how to use Forked to manage shared data in your Swift applications."}]
