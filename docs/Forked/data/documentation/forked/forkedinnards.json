At the heart of this approach lies a central coordinator, such as a lock, queue, or actor, which protects the shared resource, providing serial access to it."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"While this pattern is familiar, it comes with significant drawbacks. Changes must be synchronized through the coordinator, forcing other parts of the system to wait while changes occur. This not only creates bottlenecks and synchronization costs but also makes it challenging to reason about the system’s state, often leading to subtle race conditions."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"level":3,"type":"heading","anchor":"The-Decentralized-Way","text":"The Decentralized Way"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Forked takes inspiration from proven distributed version control systems like Git. With these systems, changes flow more naturally. Developers can work independently, without waiting to coordinate with other developers. When conflicts arise, the system has a complete picture of what’s changed through its history tracking."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"This philosophy translates directly to how Forked operates in your application. You’re free to modify data without considering other subsystems or devices, and reconciliation happens later through well-defined merge policies. The key innovation is Forked’s support for 3-way merging, where a historical “common ancestor” helps determine exactly what’s changed in each fork when a conflict arises.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"text":"The Reality of Modern Apps","anchor":"The-Reality-of-Modern-Apps","level":3,"type":"heading"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Most modern applications are inherently decentralized, whether intentional or not. Consider how your app might sync data across multiple devices, or how app extensions operate in separate processes on shared data. Even background processes performing imports or downloads from a web service must coordinate with the main app. These scenarios all represent decentralized operations, even if we often try to force them into a centralized model.","type":"text"}]},{"anchor":"Sync-Comes-for-Free","type":"heading","level":3,"text":"Sync Comes for Free"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Forked’s decentralized approach means that sync is a natural part of the system. By providing some limited history tracking, in the form of a common ancestor, as well a powerful merging, you can begin developing an app for a single device, and very simply add support for sync with no model changes, and no custom server.
